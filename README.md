# Fraud KPI Dashboard

This project simulates a fraud case management dashboard tailored for enterprise fraud strategy. It reflects the types of metrics I’ve designed and operationalized as a Fraud Manager across major financial institutions.

## Objective

Showcase how leadership uses dashboards to:
- Track fraud alert outcomes
- Monitor SAR conversion rates
- Evaluate investigator performance
- Identify trends that trigger escalations or rule refinement

## Tools

- Excel (mock data simulation)
- Tableau / Power BI (optional dashboard build)
- SQL (for backend logic prep)
- Python (optional—KPI automation prototype)

## Key KPIs Modeled

- Case Aging Distribution
- Alert-to-SAR Conversion Rate
- Fraud Typology Frequency (e.g. Synthetic ID, First-Party Fraud)
- False Positive Rate (pre- and post-logic changes)
- Investigator QA Score Tracking

## Files Included

- `fraud_kpi_sample_data.xlsx`: Mock dataset for dashboarding
- `kpi_dashboard.png`: Sample dashboard visual (to be added)
- `dashboard_queries.sql`: Query logic behind the metrics
- `README.md`: You're looking at it!

## Manager Impact

These are the dashboards I’ve used to brief senior leadership, optimize investigator output, and prioritize rule tuning sessions in fast-paced fraud environments.
